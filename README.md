**Next-generation anonymous content management with neural privacy protection** ¬∑ *For aging engineers who care about their future political careers* üèõÔ∏è

## What is reddacted?
- Clean up your online footprint without blowing away everyything, analyze the content of comments to identify anything that might be likely to reveal PII that you may not want correlated with your anonymous username and perform sentiment analysis on the content of those posts.
- Easy, lazy, self hosted - the way an aging former engineer with a career doing things right at the enterprise cale would clean up your dirty laundry.

üõ°Ô∏è **PII Detection** - Find potential personal info leaks in comments using AI/Regex
ü§´ **Sentiment Analysis** - Understand the emotional tone of your Reddit history
üîí **Zero-Trust Architecture** - Client-side execution only, no data leaves your machine unless you choose to use a hosted API. Fully compatible with all OpenAI compatible endpoints.
‚ö° **Self-Host Ready** - Run locally with Ollama/Mistral or cloud providers
üìä **Smart Cleanup** - Preserve valuable contributions while removing risky content

‚úÖ **Zero-Trust Architecture**
- Client-side execution only
- No tracking or external calls
- Session-based authentication
- Keep your nonsense comments with lots of upvotes and good vibes without unintentionally doxing yourself someday off in the future when you run for mayor.


- **Users**:  Get the sentiment based on the most recent comments submitted

## Installation ##

```bash
# Install globally
pip install .

# Or install in development mode (for contributors)
pip install -e .
```

That's it! No PATH configuration needed.

## Using the CLI ##

Install once with:
```bash
pip install .
```

Then run directly:
```bash
reddacted user <username> [--output-file analysis.txt] [--enable-auth]
reddacted listing <subreddit> <article> [--output-file results.csv]
```

Key features:
- Automatic dependency handling
- Single-command operation
- Built-in help: `reddacted --help`
- Interactive and flag driven workflows

## Troubleshooting ##

If you get "command not found" after installation:
1. Check Python scripts directory is in your PATH:
```bash
# Typical Linux/Mac location
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Typical Windows location
set PATH=%APPDATA%\Python\Python311\Scripts;%PATH%
```
2. Verify installation location:
```bash
pip show reddacted
```

## Authentication ##

Before running an commands, in order to ensure that we are able to use the reddit API consecutively, we should authenticate with reddit. In order to do this the following is required:

- **Reddit Account**: You can sign up at [https://www.reddit.com/account/register/](https://www.reddit.com/account/register/)
- **Reddit App**: Click on the **are you a developer? create an app...** button at the bottom of [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
- **Reddit API Access**: You can request access at [https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api/](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api/)

Once the above is complete, we should set the following environment variables:

```bash
$ export REDDIT_USERNAME=your-username
$ export REDDIT_PASSWORD=your-password
$ export REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
$ export REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

Now when running the CLI, all requests will be authenticated.

## Development ##

It is recommended that you first create a python virtual environment to not overwrite pip dependencies in your system. See [virtualenvs](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/):

1. Clone this repository

2. Change directory to application path

3. Install application requirements

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install required **nltk** packages

```bash
$ python -m nltk.downloader vader_lexicon
```

5. Make changes to the code

6. Install the application from source code

```bash
$ sudo python setup.py install
```

Now you can go ahead and test the new features you have implemented! Contributions welcome, feel free to contribute by:

- Opening an Issue
- Creating a PR with additions/fixes

## Testing ##

I have included a number of unit tests to validate the application. In order to run the tests, simply perform the following:

1. Install pytest

```bash
$ pip install pytest
```

2. Clone this repository

3. Change directory to application path

4. Install application requirements

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Install required **nltk** packages

```bash
$ python -m nltk.downloader vader_lexicon
```

6. Install application test requirements

```bash
$ pip install -r test-requirements.txt
```

7. Run Unit tests

```bash
$ pytest tests
```

## Common Exceptions ##

### too many requests ###

If you're unauthenticated, reddit has relatively low rate limits for it's API. Either authenticate against your account, or just wait a sec and  try again.

### the page you requested does not exist ###

Simply a 404, which means that the provided username does not point to a valid page.
